<h2>Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This report examines the historic Titanic disaster, and focuses on understanding what factors influence passengers survival in case of emergency on a vessel. We employed a statistical analysis on a plethora of parameters, such as age, sec, ticket pricing, and a number of others to determine their impact and relationship on survival likelihood of a passenger. Our report employs logistic regression analysis to understand the relationship between various parameters and survival as mentioned. Unlike predictive models, our focus is on inference, examining how factors like age, gender, class, and cabin location influenced the likelihood of survival - for this reason we only built our model off of one data set without training and testing, as we are looking to only make an inference and understand the relationship between variables. Our findings show us significant disparities, particularly highlighting the better survival chances of women and higher-class passengers - which introduces a socioeconomic factor to survival. The main results observed through our report are as followed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Passenger Class: There’s a clear negative correlation between passenger class and survival probability. Passengers in lower classes (2nd and 3rd) had significantly lower odds of surviving compared to those in 1st class.</p></li>
<li><p>Gender: Female passengers had a much higher chance of survival than male passengers.</p></li>
<li><p>Age: Age groups also played a critical role. Children had a higher survival rate, while seniors had the lowest.</p></li>
<li><p>Socio-Economic Status: Represented by fare, it had a lesser impact on survival probability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis, though limited by the historical data available, provides valuable insights into the social and personal dynamics of survival in maritime disasters. This report serves as a preliminary step into understanding what factors effect ones changes of survival in case of a maritime disaster, and can be built on upon with further feature engineering and model types to help move this analysis into the domain of prediction and making steps to reducing fatalities on water vessels.</p>

<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The sinking of the RMS Titanic, was one of the most tragic and known aquatic disasters to have ever occurred in maritime history - and is still constantly explore to this day<span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id12" title="Seth Cline. The 8 worst cruise ship disasters. 2013.">Cline, 2013</a>]</span>. On April 1912, the RMS Titanic collided with an iceberg, which lead to its sinking and the death of over 1500 people. Every year roughly 200 people die on cruises, with the last significant maritime cruise accident being the Costa Concordia in 2012, which resulted in 32 deaths and 64 injuries <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id13" title="Space Coast Daily. How many crew members die on cruise ships each year. 2023.">Daily, 2023</a>]</span>. Events like this serve as an opportunity to study safety as well as human behavior and aspects relating to ones ability to survive a catastrophic event.</p>
<p>Numerous groups and academic bodies have explored the historic consequences and results of the Titanic’s sinking, however, there remains a need to statistically break down and analyze the underlying factors that influence ones ability to survive a situation like this. The analysis seeks to understand the complexities surrounding individuals ability to survive a maritime disaster, using ‘Paul Hendricks’ Titanic data as a case study. We aim to investigate factors that contribute to understanding what elements are associated with ones ability to survive a sinking ship. Our analysis aims to statistically infer the underlying factors influencing survival. Our approach, is different from predictive modeling. To achieve appropriate results we will employ the method of Logistic Regression - a classification method used for exploring the relationships between a binary dependent or target variable (survival) and one or more independent variables of predictors (attributes of individuals on the Titanic). As mentioned above this is an inference based approach rather than a report looking to make predictions, we are interested in the associations and coefficients between variables, and will be using a single data set in order to create a model and understand the relationships between parameters. This approach will allow us to estimate the probability of the outcome of survival based on various input factors from the data set for each observation. We would be using R, <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id10" title="R Developement Core Team. R: a language and environment for statistical computing.

<section id="data">
<h2>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The data set being used in the report and which the analysis will be based on is the <em>Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set</em> data set <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id9" title="P Hendricks. Titanic: titanic passenger survival data set. R package version 0.1. 0, 2015.">Hendricks, 2015</a>]</span>, which is a compilation of passenger data from RMS Titanic. This data set is available and accessible through the ‘titanic’ library in R, or through the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/paulhendricks/titanic/tree/master">Titanic GitHub repository</a>. This package was created in 2015 by <em>Paul Hendricks</em>, and includes important features such as age, sex, ticket class, survival status, and many others. The data package contains two data sets one for training with 891 observations and one for testing with 418 observations, where each observations is a separate passenger from the Titanic - the data contains 12 variables defining unique characteristics of each passenger. The data set contains a breadth of variables such a personal features and socio-economic information which will be fruitful in the exploration of factors effecting ones survival.</p>

<section id="logistic-regression">
<h3>Logistic Regression<a class="headerlink" href="#logistic-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Since we are looking to understand and learn the relationships and associations between various variables and their impact on survival, we are looking to make inferences rather than predictions. This means that our report looks to fit a model on a single data set rather than use a train and testing set to examine our models ability to generalize on new data and make predictions. We are looking at our coefficients, their statistical significance, along with their magnitude to understand which values contribute to the likelihood of survival most.</p>
<p>For the analysis as mention we will be implementing a Logistic Regression model - this is a statistical method for modeling the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictors. In the context of our study, our binary outcome variable or target will be ‘Survived’ (denoted as ‘1’ for survived and ‘0’ for did not survive), which represents if a passenger survived the accident that occurred on the Titanic. We will be exploring the available predictors in the data set and determining which to use for the model using our reasoning with regards to what information they contribute and if they may cause multicollinearity. The predictors we will chose from are: Passenger ID, Passenger Class, Name, Sex, Age, Number of Siblings or Spouses as passenger has on board, number of Parents or Children a passenger has on board, Ticket Number, Ticket Fare, Cabin Location, ad which Port they embarked from.</p>
<p>Logistic Regression can be mathematically represented as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[log(\frac{p}{1-p})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+\cdots+\beta_{n}X_{n}\]</div>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> represents the probability of an event of interest occurring which in our case is survival, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{p}{1-p}\)</span> which is the log odds of that event occurring - which we can deduce the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> from:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[p=\frac{e^{log(\frac{p}{1-p})}}{1+e^{\frac{p}{1-p}}}\]</div>
<p>We also have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_{1}, X_{2},\cdots,X_{n}\)</span> are the predictor variable values, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta_{0},\beta_{1},\cdots,\beta_{n}\)</span> are the coefficients estimated by the model representing how the variables contribute to our log odds, when there is a one-unit change in the predictor. The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span> values will be represented by the features that we define as relevant for the analysis from our data set, these will include elements such as age, sex, passenger class, etc.</p>

<section id="consideration-of-other-models">
<h3>Consideration of other models<a class="headerlink" href="#consideration-of-other-models" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We have considered employing other models including SVC, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees in the analysis but we are motivated to solely use logisitic regression by the following factors:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ease of interpretation: Logisitic regression estimates a set of slopes and an intercept, and all that estimates can be easily interpreted - a positive (negative) slope estimate indicates a postive (negative) association between that corresponding regressor and the target. Non-linear models are typically more difficult to interpret.</p></li>
<li><p>Computationally inexpensive: The time and computational resources to run a logisitic regression is significantly smaller than other models that we have considered. Employing only logistic regression would reduce the time required to reproduce this analysis.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="selecting-from-data-set">
<h3>Selecting From Data Set<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-from-data-set" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In applying the Logistic Regression model to the Titanic Data set we aim to explore how different variables influence the likelihood of survival. Since we are only exploring estimation and understanding the relationship between our target and the predictors we will be using the training data set provided in order to fit our model and understand the relationships between features and the target. Contextually we will also select variables that make sense logically as well as in terms of contribution to avoid multicollinearity or variables that are redundant.</p>
<p>To start off we will be dropping the values that are unique and carry very little information that could help our model in its estimations, these will be predictors such as Passenger ID, Name of Passenger, and Ticket ID. At first glance, the Ticket IDs are encoded with interesting prefixes, e.g. A/5, STON/O2., etc, which might provide explantory power. However, we have found that not all tickets IDs contain such prefix, and including them would introduce noise to the model fitting. Presumably these prefixes are related to the Passenger Class, including ticket ID as a regressor risks introducing multicollinearity.</p>
<p>We also want to work on a complete data set, to avoid any unnecessary assumptions being made for imputing on missing values we will drop the Cabin variable as it is very spare and has a large number of missing values - In addition to this we will be dropping the Embarking Location variable as where the passengers got onto the ship is not relevant to the analysis since they were all on the ship once the catastrophe occurred. Regarding the variables that we are keeping, we will keep Passenger Class as this represents where in the boat they were located which can reflect their ease of exit, we will include Fare as this represents socio-economic status of how much was spent on their ticket which could result in a favorable outcome for them, we kept age and sex as this relates to the idea of ‘women and children first’ which is known as the Birkenhead Drill and is very relevant in maritime travel, we next include Sibling/Spouse and Parent/Children count to understand how one party on the boat could affect their changes of survival.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#exploratory-data-analysis" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We will be exploring the variables and features in the data set to understand their distributions and relationships. As mentioned before we will be looking at the variable Survived, Passenger Class, Sex, Number of Siblings or Spouses, Number of Children or Parents, Fare, and Age - however, we have binned our age into groups of 0-12 as Child, 13-18 as ‘Teen’, 19-60 as Adult, and over 60 as Senior. We have decided to explore the distributions of the variables and understand how they relate to our target of Survival. The plots below display the distribution of Fare, how Passenger Class relates to Survival, as well as how Sex and Age Group relates to survival.</p>

</figure>
<p>Looking at the plots we can see that there are a few trends to note, which could be interesting to look into when exploring our data and the relationship between the target and predictors. First we can see there is a right skew in fare price, the distribution has most counts to the left meaning a majority of patrons paid under 100 dollars for their ticket. We can then look at how this relates to Survival rate among the different classes of passengers - we can see as we traverse from 1st class to third, there are lower rates of survival, this could lead us to believe there is a relationship here and contextually it could be that the first class passengers had rooms higher up in the vessel which were safer when fleeing the boat. Next looking at Survival by Se we can see that female passengers had a much higher survival rate than those of male patrons, also looking at survival rate by age group we can see hat children had the highest survival rate while seniors had the lowest - the older you are the lower your survival rate it seems like. This EDA is very insightful and helpful for seeing that there may be relationships between our target and predictor variables - we will now move on to modeling.</p>

<p>Out base model is one with Passengers that are Female, are in First Class, and are in the age group of Child. We can now look at the results of our logistic regression model and inspect the coefficient values to understand what predictors effect the log odds and probability of someone surviving the Titanic.</p>
<p>The logistic regression results provide valuable insights into the factors affecting the likelihood of survival on the Titanic. Each coefficient in the table represents the log odds of survival for each unit change in the predictor, while holding all other predictors constant.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Intercept (4.8361): This value indicates the log odds of survival when all other predictors are at their reference level. In this context, it is the baseline log odds of survival for a passenger when all other variables are zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Passenger Class (Pclass2: -0.9711, Pclass3: -2.0246): These coefficients suggest that being in the 2nd or 3rd class significantly decreases the odds of survival compared to being in the 1st class. The negative values indicate that as we move from the 1st class to lower classes, the likelihood of survival decreases.</p></li>
<li><p>Gender (Sexmale: -2.7582): This significant negative coefficient for male passengers indicates that being male greatly reduces the odds of survival compared to female passengers.</p></li>
<li><p>Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp: -0.5511): A negative coefficient implies that an increase in the number of siblings or spouses aboard decreases the survival probability.</p></li>
<li><p>Parents/Children Aboard (Parch: -0.2260): Similarly, this suggests that having more parents or children aboard slightly decreases the chances of survival</p></li>
<li><p>Fare (0.0044): The positive coefficient for fare implies that higher fares slightly increase the odds of survival, possibly reflecting higher socio-economic status and access to better resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Age Group (Teen: -2.1938, Adult: -2.3263, Senior: -3.4196): These negative coefficients indicate that being a teenager, adult, or senior decreases the odds of survival compared to being a child. The effect is most pronounced for seniors.</p></li>

<h2>Summary of the Findings<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-the-findings" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This data analysis report focuses on identifying the factors that contributed to survival during the sinking of the RMS Titanic, using logistic regression analysis. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, and survival status. The analysis aims to pinpoint specific attributes that influenced the likelihood of survival.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Passenger Class: There’s a clear negative correlation between passenger class and survival probability. Passengers in lower classes (2nd and 3rd) had significantly lower odds of surviving compared to those in 1st class.</p></li>
<li><p>Gender: Female passengers had a much higher chance of survival than male passengers.</p></li>
<li><p>Age: Age groups also played a critical role. Children had a higher survival rate, while seniors had the lowest.</p></li>
<li><p>Socio-Economic Status: Represented by fare, it had a lesser impact on survival probability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the analysis provides a detailed understanding of the factors influencing survival on the Titanic. Class and gender emerged as the most significant factors, followed by age. These findings highlight the social hierarchies and norms of the time, where women and children, particularly from higher social classes, were given priority during rescue efforts. Such analyses not only shed light on historical events but also offer valuable insights for modern maritime safety and disaster management strategies.</p>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations:<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As seen in the report we made use of a logistic regression model for our analysis, however the model was never tested on any testing data as we only looked to explore relationships rather than make predictions. This limitation could be addressed in the future by applying our model to a test dataset and identifying its performance through looking at accuracy, precision, recall, and an ROC curve.
Additionally, if we had more time, it would be worth while to also model this data and the relationships using other models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines for classification. There may be more complex relationships to explore and testing this with various models could be beneficial when finding the true relationship between the target and our features. We would also like to explore a more robust method of feature selection (such as cross validation) rather than just choosing our features contextually and through 3rd party knowledge – as there may be multicollinearity that we are not accounting for and or assumptions through the method we employed. These additional efforts would help create a more robust model that we could then apply to maritime data that spans beyond the data of just Titanic patrons.</p>
