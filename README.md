## About

In our Titanic Survival Data Analysis, we delve into the factors that influenced passenger survival on this historic voyage. Leveraging advanced data analytics, we explore various elements such as passenger class, age, gender, and embarkation point to unravel patterns and insights that shaped the likelihood of survival.

The data set being used in the report and which the analysis will be based on is the *Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set* data set, which is a compilation of passenger data from RMS Titanic.
