    "\n",
    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic, was one of the most tragic and known aquatic disasters to have ever occurred in maritime history - and is still constantly explore to this day. On April 1912, the RMS Titanic collided with an iceberg, which lead to its sinking and the death of over 1500 people. Every year roughly 200 people die on cruises, with the last significant maritime cruise accident being the Costa Concordia in 2012, which resulted in 32 deaths and 64 injuries. Events like this serve as an opportunity to study safety as well as human behavior and aspects relating to ones ability to survive a catastrophic event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous groups and bodies have explored the historic consequences and results of the Titanic's sinking, however, there remains a need to statistically break down and analyze the underlying factors that influence ones ability to survive a situation like this. The analysis seeks to understand the complexities surrounding individuals ability to survive a maritime disaster, using 'Paul Hendricks' Titanic data as a case study. We aim to investigate factors that contribute to understanding what elements are associated with ones ability to survive a sinking ship. To achieve appropriate results we will employ the method of Logistic Regression - a classification method used for exploring the relationships between a binary dependent or target variable (survival) and one or more independent variables of predictors (attributes of individuals on the Titanic). This approach will allow us to estimate the probability of the outcome of survival based on various input factors from the data set for each observation.on."

    "## Data\n",
    "The data set being used in the report and which the analysis will be based on is the *Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set* data set, which is a compilation of passenger data from RMS Titanic. This data set is available and accessible through the 'titanic' library in R, or through the [Titanic GitHub repository](https://github.com/paulhendricks/titanic/tree/master). This package was created in 2015 by *Paul Hendricks*, and includes important features such as age, sex, ticket class, survival status, and many others. The data package contains two data sets one for training with 891 observations and one for testing with 418 observations, where each observations is a separate passenger from the Titanic - the data contains 12 variables defining unique characteristics of each passenger. The data set contains a breadth of variables such a personal features and socio-economic information which will be fruitful in the exploration of factors effecting ones survival."
